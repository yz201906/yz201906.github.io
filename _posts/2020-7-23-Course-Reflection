## what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do
At this moment, I feel that my expectation of being a data scientist mostly align with my previous understanding. But I was able to get a much more detailed and clearer picture rather than a vague general idea.  

## what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
Currently, R is pretty much my go-to tool for any statistical analysis. This course has helped me setting up the general work flow.  

## what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
What I have learnt is also robust to my work environment. I am most excited about using supervised learning to solve actual problems or making predictions.
