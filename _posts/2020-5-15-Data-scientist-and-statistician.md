title: Data scientist and statistician
---

From my own point of view, a data scientist is someone who approaches data from the direction of making it presentable in various ways to **aid research/business desicion-making**.  
Not to say that data science is superficial, on the contrary, it is deep enough for a data scientist to be efficienyly **building/evaluating different models** of the same data. A data scientist also need to have deep knowledge of a particular **domain** (biology, marketing etc.) in addition to sufficient statistical/analytical skills and computer science knowledge.  
My perception of the difference comes from how they approach the data that is presented. A data scientist would orient themselves toward problem solving and presentability whereas statistician usually dive deep with the model that is initially chosen and keeps refining that model. But I also agree with Nate Silver's statment to a certain degree that data science is a branch of statistics.
